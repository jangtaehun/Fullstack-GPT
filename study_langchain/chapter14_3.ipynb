      "assistant: Winston lives in Victory Mansions, which is located in London, chief city of Airstrip One in Oceania. His apartment is described as having a telescreen that is always transmitting and receiving, meaning that the government could potentially be watching at any time. His apartment contains a tiny kitchen with scarcely any food except for a hunk of dark-coloured bread. The kitchen has a shelf with a bottle of Victory Gin, which gives off a sickly, oily smell. In the living-room, there is a small table that stands to the left of the telescreen. For some reason, the telescreen is in an unusual position on the longer wall opposite the window, and there is a shallow alcove where Winston can sit to remain out of the telescreen's vision range【11†source】.\n",
      "Source: FileCitation(file_id='file-g9IIL5WN6VB8BeamseTTpkDA', quote=\"Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese ricespirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.\\n\\nInstantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful. He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover.\\n\\nFor some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position\")\n"
